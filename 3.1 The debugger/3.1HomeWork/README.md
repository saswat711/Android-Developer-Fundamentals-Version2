# All the breakpoint are disabled by default You can turn it on based on your need and the use of breakpoint is given on the code

NOTE: 
In MainActivity, a breakpoint is placed on the first line of the onAdd() method.
We can Run the app in the debugger. Perform an add operation in the app. The execution stops at the breakpoint.
Click Step Into to follow the execution of the app step by step. Note that Step Into opens and executes files from the Android framework, enabling you to see how Android itself operates on your code.
Examine how the Debug pane changes as you step through the code for the current stack frame and local variables.
Examine how the code itself in the editor pane is annotated as each line is executed.
Click Step Out to return back to your app if the execution stack gets too deep to understand.
