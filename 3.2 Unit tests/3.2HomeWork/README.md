# All the breakpoint are disabled by default You can turn it on based on your need and the use of breakpoint is given on the code

NOTE: A breakpoint is used in compute (mehtod) so that we can Use the debugger to step through the execution of the code and determine precisely why the error occurs when an operand is given empty.
after that we Fix the bug that causes this error by trying to catch the NumberFormatException . We can remove/disable the breakpoint if we want to smoothly run the app.

A breakpoint is enabled on DIV operator so that when ever the operand 2 is given 0 the app stops at the breakpoint as the divisor can't be zero and the text field shows the divisor(operand 2) value is given 0
